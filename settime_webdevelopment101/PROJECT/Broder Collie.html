    <ol type="i">
        <li>History and Origin: Border Collies are a herding breed that originated in the border regions of England and Scotland.

        <li>Size and Appearance: Border Collies are medium-sized dogs, with males typically weighing between 30-45 pounds (14-20 kg), and females weighing between 27-42 pounds (12-19 kg). They have a well-proportioned body, athletic build, and a distinctive "collie" head with alert, oval-shaped eyes and a keen expression. Border Collies come in a variety of coat colors and patterns, including black and white, red and white, tricolor, and blue merle.</li>
        <li>Intelligent and Agile: Border Collies are renowned for their intelligence and problem-solving abilities. They have been ranked as one of the most intelligent dog breeds.

        <li>Herding Instincts: Border Collies possess natural herding instincts deeply ingrained in their genetic makeup. They excel at the art of gathering, moving, and directing livestock through their intense focus and unique "eye" technique. They use their intense gaze to control the movements of animals.
