    Here are more details on Golden Retriver:
    <ol type="i">
        <li>Appearance: Adult male golden retrievers grow to be 65-75 pounds, while females are 55-65 pounds. Their coloring ranges from light golden to cream, and dark golden to golden, and their physique can vary from broad and dense to leaner and more sporty. According to AKC standards,goldens move with a smooth, powerful gait, and the feathery tail is carried, as breed fanciers say, with a "merry action."</li>
        <li>Temperament: In general, golden retrievers are outgoing, playful, and gentle. They are also friendly, intelligent, and devoted. "Golden retrievers are special because they are the perfect family dog," Ryan Steen, DVM, medical director at Frey Pet Hospital in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, says. "From a personality perspective, you'll be hard pressed to find a more loving, outgoing, eager-to-please companion." Early in their lives, they are perfect for playing with children in the backyard. As they get older, most golden retrievers become docile and calm.</li>
        <li>Living Needs: A golden retriever needs to live inside near the people he loves most. They see themselves as part of the family and need to be treated as such. Luckily, goldens are not bothered by noise, commotion, and activity, making them very tolerant of children. Golden retrievers also take a "the more the merrier" approach to having other pets in the home. With proper introductions and training, goldens can be trusted with other dogs, cats, rabbits, and other animals. </li>
        <li>Care: "Anyone considering getting a golden retriever should know they are getting a loyal companion, but one that sheds. A lot," Steen says. Owners should get used to having a fair amount of dog hair on clothing and furniture around the home. They have a thick, water-repellant double coat that sheds moderately in the winter and summer, and heavily in the spring and fall. However, if you brush your golden daily, you can prevent tangling and remove some dead hair before it covers everything in sight. Baths can also help and are recommended about once a month, but make sure the golden is fully dry before brushing begins.</li>
        <li>Health: Golden retrievers typically live to be about 10-12 years old. According to Steen, they are a generally healthy breed, but goldens are at a slightly increased risk of hip dysplasia and cancer when compared to other dogs. Other health conditions, although not particularly common, include elbow dysplasia, cataracts, progressive retinal atrophy—or gradual deterioration of the retina—hypothyroidism, gastric dilatation-volvulus (otherwise known as bloat), and allergies. Golden retrievers should also have their ears checked often and teeth brushed regularly for optimum health.</li>
